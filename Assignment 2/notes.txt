2.1

1. To open scratch buffer, use the command C-x b.
I then typed: (* (expt 2 (1- 607)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))
To compute the result, I used the command C-j.

2. I used a combination of ceiling (rounds up to the nearest integer) and the log command to determine how many bits it would take to represent this number in base-2 notation.
I typed: (+ (ceiling (log (expt 2 (1- 607)) 2)) (ceiling (log (- (expt 2 607) 1) 2)))
This gave me the integer 1213.

3. C-h k is the "help describe key", which opens a mini buffer that allows you to type a command which it will describe the function of. Therefore, typing C-h k again will describe the functions of it, which I described above.

4. Again, C-h k is the "help describe key", which opens a mini buffer that allows you to type a command which it will describe the function of. Therefore, typing M-SPC will describe the functions of M-SPC. The M-SPC command is used to remove all spaces and tabs around the cursor besides one space. If N is negative, it delete newlines as well.

5. The more general function of M-SPC is M-x just-one-space.

Homework:

When you run randline.py on /dev/null it raises the IndexError and fails because the file is empty because it cannot pick a random index of line because there are no lines.

When you run landline.py on python3 it won't run because line 65 has invalid syntax for python3.

Homework:

My shuf.py works both on python3 and python2.
